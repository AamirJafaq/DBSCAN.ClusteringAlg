# DBSCAN.ClusteringAlg
DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is a clustering algorithm that groups points closely packed together (points with many nearby neighbors) and marks points in sparse regions as noise or outliers. It is well-suited for identifying clusters of arbitrary shape and handling noise.
